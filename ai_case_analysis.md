# 👀 AI Detective on the Case: When Robots Get It Wrong  
By Jackline Kibiwot - AI Inspector  

Hey there! I’ve been handed my AI detective badge and it's time to investigate two robot systems causing big problems in the real world. Let’s jump into the mystery... 🕵🏽‍♀️💻



## 🚨 Case 1: The Hiring Robot That Doesn’t Like Breaks  

### 🧐 What’s happening?  
There’s a company using an AI robot to decide who gets called for a job interview. But guess what? It keeps rejecting women who have a gap in their CVs — maybe because they were taking care of a baby or sick family member.

### 😬 What’s the problem?  
This robot was trained using old hiring data. If the old bosses were unfair and mostly picked men with no career breaks, the robot just copies that. That’s **not fair**. It’s like saying, “You took time off? You're out!” 🚫

### 🛠️ How can we fix it?  
- Train the robot again using fair and new data.  
- Let people see why they were rejected.  
- Get a real human to double-check before rejecting someone just because they took a break.

📢 People aren’t robots. Life happens — and that shouldn’t ruin your chances at a job!


## 🚨 Case 2: The Exam Robot That Thinks You’re Cheating  

### 🧐 What’s happening?  
At some schools, there’s a robot watching students through the webcam during online exams. It flags kids for “cheating” if they move their eyes too much or don’t look straight at the screen.

### 😬 What’s the problem?  
Some students, like those with autism, ADHD, or anxiety, move more naturally. That doesn’t mean they’re cheating! But the robot can’t tell the difference. It treats everyone the same — and that’s not fair either.

### 🛠️ How can we fix it?  
- Teach the robot that people behave differently.  
- Make sure a real teacher looks at the alerts before accusing anyone.  
- Let students see what the robot flagged and explain themselves.

🎓 Everyone deserves a fair chance — especially during exams!



## 💡 Final Thought from the AI Detective  

Robots are smart, but they’re not perfect. If we don’t watch them closely, they can be unfair without even knowing it. That’s why people like us — Responsible AI Inspectors — are so important.

We speak up, fix the bugs, and make tech better for everyone.  
Until next time, keep asking questions and judging the bots! 😉
